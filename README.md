## Gitpod Workspace
This Gitpod Workspace comes with pypy3 installed.
You can use `pypy3` instead of `python3` to increase the speed.

## Tasks
Many of the tasks are from Rosetta Code. You can view them here: [Rosetta Code Tasks](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks)

The following Tasks are already implemented by me:

*No Tasks yet*

## Algorithms
You can find the Algorithms in the [Algorithms folder](https://github.com/garlontas/programming-tasks/tree/main/Algorithms). Currently the implementations for the following Algorithms are available:

- Sieve of Eratosthenes (Prime Generator)
